/* As of Sept 2024, the app permissions hooks supplied by the expo libraries don't trigger component updates
 * when app permissions are updated. Instead, the permissions object stays stale until the next call to
 * get() or request().
 * This hook wraps the library-supplied hooks and should cause components to update when permissions are
 * updated in the app via this hook's request(), or after they are updated outside the app.
 * For the hook behavior to be fully correct, all components must use the updated hook, not the expo one.

 * Note: There is an assumption here that the only time the permissions will change is: 
 *   - As a result of calling the context's updated request() method
 *   - While the app state is not "active"
 * If you encounter bugs with this hook, check if these assumptions are still correct.
