 * A record of the sync state of some piece of data.
 *
 * Sync records track the modification history of the data via an incrementing revision ID and modification timestamp.
 * They can be marked as "synced", which records the last-synced data state and revision ID. They can also be marked
 * with "errors", which also records the revision ID that caused the error but retaining the last-synced data from the
 * last successful sync.
 *
 * Records are initialized with some piece of data (possibly no data) and have no modification or sync metadata until
 * added by other methods.
 *
 * It is intended that individual sync records are immutable for their lifetime; their associated methods are all pure
 * functions which return new objects containing updated state for the various operations they perform.
